Hey there, I'm Emile ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a frontend engineer based in San Francisco, CA. Born and raised in Palo Alto, CA I graduated from UC Santa Cruz with a degree in political science before discovering my passion for building on the web. Formerly @doctor.com for 4 years, I mainly work with JavaScript and React, but these days I'm starting to play around with some Python as well.
